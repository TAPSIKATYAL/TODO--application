# TODO Application

This TODO application is designed to help you manage your tasks efficiently. By using local storage, the application ensures that your tasks are saved and retrievable across different browsing sessions. This project will guide you through handling form inputs, managing local storage, and performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks. You will also learn how to implement event listeners and toggle UI elements to enhance user interaction.

## Features

- **Persistent Data Storage**: Utilizes local storage to save tasks persistently in the user's browser.
- **Form Handling**: Manages user input from forms to create new tasks.
- **CRUD Operations**: Allows you to create, read, update, and delete tasks.
- **Event Listeners**: Implements event listeners for handling user interactions.
- **UI Toggling**: Toggles UI elements to reflect the current state of the task list.

##Usage
- **Add a Task**: Enter a task in the input field and click the "Add" button. The task will be saved in local storage and displayed in the task list.
- **Read Tasks**: On page load, all tasks stored in local storage will be displayed.
- **Update a Task**: Click on a task to edit its content. The updated task will be saved in local storage.
- **Delete a Task**: Click the delete button next to a task to remove it from the list and local storage.

TODO Application
This TODO application is designed to help you manage your tasks efficiently. By using local storage, the application ensures that your tasks are saved and retrievable across different browsing sessions. This project will guide you through handling form inputs, managing local storage, and performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks. You will also learn how to implement event listeners and toggle UI elements to enhance user interaction.

Features
Persistent Data Storage: Utilizes local storage to save tasks persistently in the user's browser.
Form Handling: Manages user input from forms to create new tasks.
CRUD Operations: Allows you to create, read, update, and delete tasks.
Event Listeners: Implements event listeners for handling user interactions.
UI Toggling: Toggles UI elements to reflect the current state of the task list.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this application, you need a modern web browser that supports local storage (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

Installation

styles.css: Provides the styling for the application.
app.js: Contains the JavaScript code for handling form inputs, managing local storage, and implementing CRUD operations.
Key Concepts
Local Storage: A web browser feature that allows web applications to store key-value pairs persistently. This application uses local storage to save tasks so they persist between sessions.
Form Handling: Techniques for capturing and processing user input from forms.
CRUD Operations: Basic operations for managing data - Create, Read, Update, and Delete.
Event Listeners: JavaScript functions that wait for specific events (e.g., clicks, form submissions) to occur and execute code in response.
UI Toggling: Dynamically changing the user interface to reflect the application's state, such as showing or hiding tasks.
